# TShirts
A python 2.7 script I made when I was my fraternity PR Chair so I could determine who had not yet provided me their t shirt sizes.

I used this script to print out the emails of those that haven't responded so that I could batch bcc:email them and shame them into responding to me :)

By cross-referencing the list of active members and the emails available in my survey response spreadsheet, I was able to isolate the slackers and harrass them until I got their t shirt size.
